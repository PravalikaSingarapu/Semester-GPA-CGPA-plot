This repository contains a simple and reproducible Python script to visualize semester-wise academic performance using Semester GPA and Cumulative GPA (CGPA). The goal of this project is not to emphasize absolute grades, but to clearly communicate academic trends over time using clean and interpretable data visualization.

The plot includes contextual academic identifiers such as institution name and degree, along with light annotations to highlight performance variations across semesters. The visualization is designed with clarity, accessibility, and minimalism in mind.
